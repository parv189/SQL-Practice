Tables and keys

table - made up of rows and columns
ex-student 
column - define an attribute of table ex-name,id
row - represent individual entree ex-raj,24

primary key - each table has a primary key which specifies specific row ex-id
used to differentiate between two rows
denoted with underline

foreign key - it's primary key of other table or same table
refrence to the other table row
can have more then 1 foreign keys

composite key - when 1 key can't identify each row uniquely then we use more then 1 attribute as composite key
it's two columns uniquely identify a row
